## Rickshaw

### Context
A local rickshaw service in Biratnagar needs a simple tool to calculate fares for their customers. The fare calculation has a few components: a base fare, a per-kilometer charge, and a per-minute charge. They also offer discounts for locals on long distances and have a surcharge for night-time travel.

### Problem
The rickshaw drivers need a program that can:
- Take distance (in km) and time (in minutes) as input.
- Ask if the customer is a local and if the travel is during the night. (Hint: use terinary operator)
- Calculate the total fare based on the rules.
- Display the final fare in a clear, Nepali format (e.g., "Rs. 550").
